                    Elizabeth Duarte is the Transportation Director of the Municipality of the Greater San Juan Islands, a division of the local government that operates Atlantis Hub. Her department is responsible for displaying transportation data on large environmental displays in the airport, train stations, and ferry docks for Atlantis customers. In addition to offering highly readable displays of changing transportation data, Elizabeth aims to educate the public about the ease with which travelers can make itineraries by combining plane, train, and ferry trips through her new program, the PTF Pass, which allows customers a great value and a lot of flexibility.</p>

He regularly invites his children and grandchildren to his house on San Juan Island and intends to give them PTF passes so that they can travel to Roche Habour, Yacht Haven, and Friday Harbour on SanJuan Islands and to his cabins on Orcas Island and Stuart Island. He wants to be able to use his home on San JuanIsland as a base so his guests can plan fun tourist itineraries.</p>

                    Patrick Mulvaney, is an environmental engineer for a EnCo, a large energy company in the region. As an engineer for EnCo who is stationed in Seattle, Patrick spends an average of three days per week visiting drilling and wind power sites throughout the San Juan Islands. Because weather often influences his travel from Seattle, through Victoria, and between the islands, Patrick welcomes the new PTF Pass program that allows his company to purchase multiple trips on planes, trains, and ferries so that he can optimize his travel on-the-fly, to accommodate changing weather conditions.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>Our final design includes a refined version of our planner and traveler screens. We thought it was important to cater to each of these phases of users, so we decided two screens would be the most effective, thus the name TWO FOLD. We chose to use only PTF pass data to advertise the flexibility the plan offers. The screen acts as a marketing pitch for Elizabeth Duarte, and may also encourage transportation carriers to support the PTF program and gain access to a new client base. The heading of each screen is uniform in style. All destinations on either screen are highlighted in green to draw the attention of the user, and consistent use of gray cards give users all the information they need about a trip (identification, departure time, departure location, status, and modality). Page flip graphics afford that users can flip between browsing screens.</p>
